I have successfully gathered the entire project structure, source code, database schema, and configuration. I will now generate the "Master Manifest" as a single, comprehensive Markdown document.

This manifest will include:
1.  **Project Structure**: A complete tree view of all files and directories.
2.  **Configuration**: Tailwind config, global CSS/Theme variables, and build settings.
3.  **Database Schema**: A consolidated SQL representation of all tables, RLS policies, and functions based on the current system state.
4.  **Edge Functions**: The complete source code for `face-enroll`, `face-search`, and `manager-pin`.
5.  **Source Code**:
    *   **Core**: `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, types, and utilities.
    *   **Hooks**: All custom hooks for data and logic.
    *   **Pages**: Full code for all application routes.
    *   **Components**: All custom components (grouped by feature: Kiosk, Scheduler, Staff, etc.).

This document will serve as a complete backup and reference for the PocketCafe application.
